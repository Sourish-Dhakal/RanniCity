                        One of our goals when making our cities is sustainability. We want to be able to support  ourselves for as long as possible. It's important to have resources for the future generations and we build our cities with that in mind. We aim to make sure that all the natural resources are safe and that everything is as sustainable as possible. From supporting sustainability to being made out of sustainable resources, we aim to make sure everything we design is as sustainable as possible.

                        We make sure to research the area we're about to change before we actually change it so that we can find any issues with the area. Our latest project, The Ranni City, has been researched as well. We have identified some problems inside it such as overpopulation, climate change and lack of clean area. We have found ways to solve these issues such as a lot of apartments, laws to keep trees inside the city and a policy to support gardening.

                        We are dedicated to keeping the communities sustainable, and one of the cornerstones of sustainability is environmental sustainability. Which means we have to make sure the ecosystem is good and will be able to survive urbanization. This can cause the roads to look more green with a lot more trees and there to just be more green area in general. We make sure that it's always pleasing to be around and that it's a place anybody would want to go to.
